Description: Performs hybrid multiple testing that incorporates method
        selection and assumption evaluations into the analysis using
        empirical Bayes probability (EBP) estimates obtained by
        Grenander density estimation. For instance, for 3-group
        comparison analysis, Hybrid Multiple testing considers EBPs as
        weighted EBPs between F-test and H-test with EBPs from Shapiro
        Wilk test of normality as weigth. Instead of just using EBPs
        from F-test only or using H-test only, this methodology
        combines both types of EBPs through EBPs from Shapiro Wilk test
        of normality. This methodology uses then the law of total EBPs.
