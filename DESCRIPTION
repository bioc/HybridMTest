Description: Performs hybrid multiple testing that incorporates method selection and
 assumption evaluations into the analysis using empirical Bayes probability (EBP) estimates
 obtained by Grenander density estimation. For instance, for 3-group comparison analysis, 
 Hybrid Multiple testing considers EBPs as weighted EBPs between
 F-test and H-test with EBPs from Shapiro Wilk test of normality as weigth. 
 Instead of just using EBPs from F-test only or using H-test only, this methodology combines 
 both types of EBPs through EBPs from Shapiro Wilk test of normality.
 This methodology uses then the law of total EBPs.
